## Technologies used

### Typescript

To develop a web app, Typescript provides the benefits of object oriented programming while being able to leverage the full power of Javascript as a web programming language. For that reason, Typescript was the language of choice.

### React 

For a web app that needs many real-time updates, React is a great technology choice since it is optimized for faster and efficient rendering with the help of the internal ReactDOM. For that reason, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### Stardust UI

Explored several libraries that provide UI plug-and-play React components to simplify development. For the components I needed, [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) seemed to have a lot of good support as well as recommendation from the community. However, it seemed like it did not have too many recent updates. I learnt that developers of Semantic UI React had forked and developed [Stardust UI React](https://stardust-ui.github.io/react/) more recently. Having found the same value plus the recency in updates, this became a good choice.
